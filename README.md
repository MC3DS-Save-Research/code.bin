# code.bin
A very early Ghidra decompiation of Minecraft: New 3DS Edition's `code.bin`.  It's basically useless in its current state, but is the first public `code.bin` decompilation, after so many private ones

## Usage
This is an export of a Ghidra project.  To import it, zip the contents of the "mc3ds.gar" folder, and change its file extension from `.zip` to `.gar`  
Then it can be imported into Ghidra like a binary, simply use "File > Import file..."
